What I changed
News now auto-uses the active backend base (3001 → 3002 fallback) instead of a hardcoded port.
Added a status “lamp” and current base to:
CV (already there)
Software (new chips)
News (new chips)
Logs helper endpoints in the Admin view now also use the dynamic backend base.
logs.html now auto-detects the backend and shows which base it used in the status line.
Files changed
index.html
News API calls updated to dynamic base:
loadNewsAdmin, deleteNewsAdmin, saveNewsAdmin, submitNewsAdmin now call getBackendBase() + /news[…].
Error text now shows the actual base (not hardcoded “port 3001”).
New status chips:
Software: spans with ids soft-backend-chip and soft-backend-base.
News: spans with ids news-backend-chip and news-backend-base.
Status wiring:
On tab switch: checkBackendStatusFor() runs for Software and News too.
On general refresh: status updates now also refresh Software + News chips.
Logs actions in Admin:
/logs/append, /logs/update, /logs/delete now use getBackendBase().
Public news loader (bottom of file): now fetches from getBackendBase() + /news before falling back to news.json.
logs.html
Added small getBackendBase + auto-detect (3001→3002) helper.
Health check and “Run workflow” use the detected base; status shows “backend online • http://localhost:3002” (for example).
